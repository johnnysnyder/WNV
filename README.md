The main paper for submission is the word document: WNV_GoCode.docx
Visualizations are saved in a .twbx format (Tableau) for ease of viewing
and exploration of data filters. The free Tableau Reader (if needed) can 
be obtained at: https://www.tableau.com/
Additional files including spreadsheets, word documents, and pdf files are contained in the compressed folder WNV.zip, and the video presentation is the file WNV_GoCode.mp4 (Note: the video file was too large (>25MB)and rejected by GitHub. The video was submitted via the GoCode semi-finalist submission form)
